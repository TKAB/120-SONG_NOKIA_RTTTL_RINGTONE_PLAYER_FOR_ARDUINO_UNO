serious sketch with 120 tones are randomly played on an Arduino UNO.

To mix the output of the signals to output to a small speaker (i.e. 8 Ohms or higher),simply use a near 100 Ohm resistor from an output pin and tie it at the speaker.
Don't forget to connect the other side of the speaker to ground!


I've modified and verified the whole code into another level using chibiOS, one of the smallest and efficient RTOS for Arduino. ChibiOS is under license of GPL3. You could find more
about chibiOS at http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php . You could easily add the chibiOS library to any Arduino 1.0.1 .ino projects. It is almost neutral to any version control issues.

You can get more RTTTL (RingTone Text Transfer Language) songs by googling the world. ^^
